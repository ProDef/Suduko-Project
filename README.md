Suduko-Project
==============

Week 4 Project producing a program to solve a Suduko game.

This is a program you can use to solve an easy Sudoku game. The methos and test are quite easy to read and can be easily picked up by any experienced or amateur programmemer

We've also included an additional test to see if we could solve a random generated puzzle from online, see if you can use this as a tempplate to creating your own Sudoku solving code. Remember there are more ways to skin a cat than just one.
